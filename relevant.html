      	<h3> CodePath University </h3>
        <time>December 2015 - May 2016</time> 
        <p>Along with 6 other student leaders, we launched the CodePath University program at Fordham University. As a Student Leader, I guided a group of 13 other students through weekly Swift and Xcode tutorials. Each week, we built a new iOS app while integrating existing APIs. We had a heavy focus on understanding and implementing views, navigation bars, transitions, and animations.</p>

        <p>As a web intern, this position really gave me the in depth glimpse into HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I assisted in HTML design and content layout to be more user friendly. I created online surveys and contests that boosted funding and visibility, while also advertising all forms of events on social media and other platforms. </p>

      <h3> Code Interactive </h3>
        <time>May 2014 - April 2015</time> 
        <p>As a part of an afterschool program, I served as a coding mentor to 11th graders in the Bronx. I helped staff small and large scale HTML and CSS lectures, while strategizing with team members on how to increase student involvement.</p>
