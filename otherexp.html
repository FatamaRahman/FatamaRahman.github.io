        <p>As a committee member (Oct 2015 - May 2016), I helped hosted transitional events for the entire graduating class that focused on post graduation opportunities, networking, resume building, and job hunting. As the Co-Chair this year (May 2016 - present), I am in charge of leading all of those events while planning and executing the culmination of our four years at Fordham, Senior Week!</p>

        <p>As a member of Fordham University's Budget Committee, we hold biweekly meetings for clubs to request money for various events all across campus. As a committee member, we distribute a budget of over $200,000.00 to over 51 clubs on campus.

      <h3> Commuter Freshmen Mentor Program </h3>
        <time>May 2014 - present</time> 
        <p>As a Commuter Freshman Mentor (CFM), I help with the transition of 20-30 commuter freshmen during their entire freshman year. I along with 8 other mentors plan large scale events for the entire commuting freshman class. However, I plan small scale events for my individual group such as dinner outings, game nights, picnics, bowling night, etc. I also hold office three times a week for mentees to come visit and ask questions.</p>

        <p>As one of the three branches of student government at Fordham, we hold weekly general meetings, large scale school-wide events, and create commuter friendly spaces around the campus. We represent the needs and voices of the commuter population at Fordham University. As the president (Aug 2014 - May 2015), I represented CSA at all meetings with higher administration, led executive board meetings, and brainstormed ideas for future events. As the treasurer (May 2015 - present), I maintain all budget records, create a budget for each semester, as well as brainstorm fun ways to stay under budget while still hosting fun events for commuters across campus. </p>

In March 2015, I traveled to the Dominican Republic to work with the Joan Rose Foundation and learn about the strict new laws that discriminated against Haitian citizens in the Dominican Republic. In January 2016, I traveled to Kolkatta, India to work with the Missionaries of Mother Teresa and work with young children who are discriminated against because of their poverty.</p>

      <h3> College for Every Student </h3>
        <time>Oct 2010 - June 2013</time> 
        <p>As a member of College for Every Student (CFES), I represented our high school during all conferences domestic and international. The mission of our program was to show students in our high school (where many students were not citizens of the U.S. and/or living under the poverty line) that college is an opportunity open and possible for anyone. Thus, we created college tours to show my peers what an actual college campus looks like. We also created after school programs where students can come and get help with the college admissions process from fellow peers and from our advisors. </p>
