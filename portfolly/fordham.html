  <h1> Fordham University Website </h1>
  <p> The official website for Fordham University. </p>
  <hr>
</div>

<div class="container">

  <h1> Overview </h1>
  <p> In 2015, the redesign of Fordham University's official website had begun.
    Through detailed analysis of user flows and surveys, we realized that the
    website had to be redone so that users can navigate through the site much
    more efficiently. Seeing as how the legacy site looked and felt outdated,
    the university redesigned the website into more of a modern PHP driven web
    page. We used an external analytics site to measure how long users were on
    a page, where the pages were terminated, where people pressed back, etc.</p>

  <h1> My Role</h1>
  <p>As the Web Intern for the Online Communications team, I helped create IAs,
    create templates for homepages, document pages, profile pages, news feeds,
    event pages, etc. I dynamically incorporated updates into CMS so that
    university faculty could update their pages themselves. I also focused on
    making sure that all I programmed a tutorial for all new Jadu users that
    demo'd the entire site to a new user in a QA environment. I also created a
    style guide so that future interns and web engineers would easily be able to
    identify colors and fonts. Because we were a university, we had a very
    strict branding identity to stick to.</p>

    <h1> Skills Used </h1>
    <p> HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, CMS, Jadu, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. </p>

  <h1> Goals </h1>
  <p> We had been told by the Admissions office that more and more perspective
  students and families kept calling for information that was already available
  to them on the university website. However, many parents had said that they
  couldn't find the information they were looking for. Not only did we want to
  modernize and condense information, but make the information more easily
  accessible. Being a student myself, I had first hand experience with difficulties
  navigating the platform. I've heard things like, "I can't find the requirements for my
  major.", "Where's information on financial aid?", ""</p>

  <h1> Legacy Site </h1>
  <p> This are some examples from the legacy website. </p>
